1. Advanced Funnel Analysis:
a. User Segmentation:
Platform: We already know that the majority of users are on iOS. We can further break down the funnel metrics by platform to see if there's a significant difference in user behavior between iOS, Android, and Web users.

Age Range: Analyze the funnel metrics by age range to see if certain age groups are more likely to complete the funnel than others.

Other Attributes: Depending on the available data, we can also segment by other attributes like location, time of day, etc.

b. Time Series Analysis:
Monthly Growth: Calculate the month-over-month growth rate in ride requests, signups, and other funnel steps.

Seasonal Patterns: Identify any seasonal trends in the data, such as increased ride requests during holidays or specific months.

c. Conversion Rates:
Calculate the conversion rate between each step of the funnel. This will help identify where the most significant drop-offs occur and where there might be opportunities for improvement.
2. Geolocation Analysis:
a. Convert Coordinates to City Names:
Use the geolocation API to convert the pickup and dropoff coordinates into city names. This will give us a clearer understanding of where rides are being requested and completed.
b. Popular Cities for Rides:
Identify the cities with the highest number of ride requests and completed rides. This can help target marketing efforts or operational improvements in those areas.
c. Regional Patterns:
Analyze if there are any patterns or trends related to specific regions. For example, are there certain cities where rides are more likely to be canceled or not completed?
3. Data Preparation for Visualization:
Use Python and the pandas library to preprocess the data. This might involve aggregating data, calculating averages, or creating new metrics.

Once the data is in the desired format, export it to a CSV or Excel file. This file can then be imported into Tableau for visualization.
