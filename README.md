# Metrocar Funnel Analysis Mastery Project

This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app (similar to Uber/Lyft), to identify areas for improvement and optimization. You will use SQL to query the data and Tableau or Google Sheets for data visualization.

The stakeholders have asked several business questions that can uncover valuable insights for improving specific areas of the customer funnel. Your task is to conduct a funnel analysis and address the business questions. Explain your reason for your recommendations based on insights retrieved from the data.
